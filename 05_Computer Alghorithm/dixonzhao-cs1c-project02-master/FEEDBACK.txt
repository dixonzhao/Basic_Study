FEEDBACK:

Accepting as on time.


Good implementation of the parameterized findSubset() method. You are very close.
	However, consider optimizing it so it can handle larger sets such as a larger
	set of 12 elements.
	

-1 Incomplete implementation of class SubsetSum findSubset() method does not 
   successfully find existing subset whose total matches target.
   See sample output below.
   
   
-1 Incomplete implementation of class SubsetSum findSubset() method does not 
   find closest subset < target when no exact match exists.
   See sample output below.
   	

-1 Incomplete implementation of class Subset findSubset() method does
   not find subsets in a reasonable amount of time. Why are you trying
   to find the powerset instead of the proposed algorithm in modules?
   See sample output showing incomplete run.
      	
-0 Check your index.html subsetsum documentation which is difficult to 
   read due to extraneous symbols.
   
Nice use of annotations in your SubsetSum class.

-Bita.
