FEEDBACK:

Excellent implementation of queue structure!
Suggestion: Parameterize the generic interface Iterable.


Very good use of exception handling when dequeuing from an empty Queue.


Iterable is a raw type. References to generic type Iterable<T> should be parameterized


Good descriptive README describing the purpose of each file.
   However, I'm still unclear why you are submitting a Java file to
   keep track of the project requirements when it is not referenced.

-Bita.
