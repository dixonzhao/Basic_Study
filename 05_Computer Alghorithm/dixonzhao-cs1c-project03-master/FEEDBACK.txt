-10% late submission.


Good testing of your implementation. You're very close. See suggestions
    below.
    
    
Efficient implementation of clearing the stack!


-0 incomplete .gitignore file. Results on your "Temp_Output" folder is being committed 
   to repository. Why are you submitting compiled .class files?


-0 Remove the parameter for inner class Node as follows:   
      public class Node
      { ... }
   Otherwise the parameter MyType of inner class Node will
   hide the type of the outer StackList class. 
   Essentially writing:
       public class StackList<MyType> ...
       { 
           MyType memberVar;
           
           public class Node<MyType>
           { 
               MyType someVar; 
           }
       }
   Is the same as writing:
       public class StackList<MyType> ...
       { 
           MyType memberVar;
           
           public class Node<AnotherType>
           { 
               AnotherType someVar; 
           }
       }
    which may introduce unwanted side effects and bugs.


-1 incomplete implementation of class Navigator setCurrentLink() method does not
   successfully reset the forwardLinks stack.
   See sample output below.

   Suggestion: Try the adding a few links to your browserâ€™s forward links stack.
               Then, go to a new page. What happens?
    Then call the class StackList clear() method:
       forwardLinks.clear()  
       
-Bita.
