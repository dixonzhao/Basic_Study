-8 Missing class FHhashQPwFind resulting in compilation error:
FHhashQPwFind cannot be resolved to a type


Good concise description of the purpose of each file in your README.
    However, some of the terminology you use is non-standard and hence
    unclear. For example, what do you mean by "run with both reverse case"?


Extra Credit Opportunity:
+0 How did you generate the data in your RUN.txt file?
   Why does the statements: "Finding song id: 4
                           Song id 4 found in tableOfSongIDs.
   repeat many times?
   I'm unable to give your credit for your work when it is unclear
   how you generated your data.

    In your README.txt why are you comparing Linear Probing with Quadratic Probing?
    For future read the project description carefully so you receive 
    credit for your work.
    
    
For future make sure to follow the complete project requirements. The required
   elements are necessary for you me to better understand your analysis in order
   to give you credit.
       
-Bita.
