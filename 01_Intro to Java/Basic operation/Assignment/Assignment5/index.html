	<h1>CS1A GUI Assignment 5</h1>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">By Dr. Baba Kofi Weusijana</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Developed Summer 2017</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
		<br /> Your group must read <strong>all</strong> the module items
		starting with "Baby GUIs" through " Transporter Price Version" in
		order to complete this assignment. Put the code from the " Transporter
		Price Version" into a <strong>separate project</strong> and get it
		working. Then you all can use it as a guide to how to write the code
		for your ControlsFrame class.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Your student group&rsquo;s assignment
		is to make a non-robotic Java Program that has a Graphical User
		Interface(GUI) using Java&rsquo;s AWT(Abstract Windowing Toolkit) and
		Swing components. The finished program should use the provided Gallery
		class and will show 10 movie posters (one poster at at time) whose
		ImageDisplay instance is placed into a JFrame and controlled by an
		instance of the ControlsFrame class. Your group will write the
		ControlsFrame class, the Gallery and ImageDisplay classes are already
		written for you. The ImagesDisplay class can be run as an application
		to show you (the developer) how it works. Regular users will run the
		Gallery class as an application. The final result of running the
		Gallery class application should look like this.</p>

		From the dropdown combobox control a user can choose to interactively
		display 1 of 10 posters. Three poster files are provided. You should
		find other 7-10 posters of your own by doing image searches with <a
			href="https://search.creativecommons.org/">https://search.creativecommons.org/</a>
		and include the image files in the project in the top-level project
		folder next to the other images. You can find out more about the Image
		class and images it supports with the getImage method at <a
			target="_blank"

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Users must also be able to set the
		size of the JFrame the ImageDisplay instance has been added to by
		entering whole numbers into labeled width and height text areas and
		clicking a button labeled &ldquo;Set Size&rdquo;.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Your group will need to convert the
		Strings from the width and height text areas into ints for calling the
		setSize method on the JFrame that contains the ImageDisplay instance.
		You can do it like this:</p>
	<pre>jFrame.setSize(Integer.parseInt(widthTextArea.getText()),<br />               Integer.parseInt(heightTextArea.getText()));</pre>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
		The Integer class is a wrapper class for the primitive int type and
		parseInt is one of its static methods, so you don't have to make an
		instance of Integer to use it. For more info see:<br /> <a
