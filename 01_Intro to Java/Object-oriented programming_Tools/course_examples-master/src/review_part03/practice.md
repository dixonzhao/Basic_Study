Problem 1
---------
**Assume we have a class `Folder` defined with the following three class fields:**

```java
    String name;
    int [] fileIDs;
    int permissions;
```

**Describe the difference between making a *shallow copy* and a *deep copy* of `myDocuments` initialized below.**

```java
    // somewhere in main
    int [] docs = {111, 112, 115, 201};
    Folder myDocuments = new Folder("documents", docs);
```
