Week 4 Part 1 Practice Problems
========================

Learning Objectives
-------------------
- Creating `FriendNode` objects
- Connecting `FriendNode` objects via `next` attribute


<br><br>

Problem 1
---------
**Given the `FriendNode` class:**

1. Create *three* `FriendNode` objects `happy`, `sleepy`, `grumpy`. In order, assign the following names: `“happy”`, `“sleepy”`, `“grumpy”`. 
<br>

2. Then link the nodes together as follows:
    - `happy`’s `next` attribute is pointing to `sleepy`
    - `sleepy`’s `next` attribute is pointing to `grumpy`
    - Draw a diagram representing our list of friends?


3. Imagine you had only the reference `happy`. 
	- Starting at `happy` use 3 statements to print one node at a time.
	
	- Starting at `happy` use a loop to print `all` your nodes.
