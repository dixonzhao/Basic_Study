FEEDBACK:

Overall, well done in sticking to it this quarter.


-0 Check for spelling errors in your README.txt file as it makes 
   your description difficult to read!
  

Very good outline in your README file. The description of a few
   items is unclear. Please see below.


-0 Why not provide snapshots which also show a subset of the countries?


-0 Missing parameter in class GraphView for LineChart instances. For example, define
   the parameter as follows:
   LineChart<Number,Number> lineC;


-0 The buttons on the left side are not readable by default. Consider
   setting the default size of the window so these are readable.
     
  
Extra Credit Opportunity 1:
+0 Your README states that you graphed a second data set?
   Where is the data in your project? For example, did you include a second
   CSV file? Would you share this file?  Would you share a link to where 
   you found your data?


Extra Credit Opportunity 2:
+0 Without a second data set, what are you switching the data between.
   In order to receive credit you must complete extra credit opportunity 1
   as required by project description. See excerpt:
   "To receive the full extra credit:
        Make sure that your implementation and submission meets the 
		rest of the project requirements and have completed extra credit 
		opportunity 1 described above."   
   
-Bita.
