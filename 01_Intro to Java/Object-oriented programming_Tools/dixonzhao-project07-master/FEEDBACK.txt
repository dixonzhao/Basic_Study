Accepted as on time.

Well done in converting your implementation to a generic data structure!


Good implementation of class LinkedList contains() method by overriding and calling the equals() method! 


-0 Why do you need the default LinkedList() constructor which as no behavior?
   Remove this unless is modifying the object.
   Next time minus for this.


-0 The Node class is generic. Hence, references of type Node should also be generic. 
   Instead of:
public class LinkedList<T> implements Iterable{
	 private Node begin;
	 private Node temp;
	 
   Specify the generic type that the Linked List class is using:
public class LinkedList<T> implements Iterable{
	 private Node<T> begin;
	 private Node<T> temp;
	 
   Otherwise, it defaults to a "raw" type which in this case is the Object class. As 
   a result we loose the advantage of compilation checks on generic types.


-1 Incomplete implementation of class Country getNumSupscriptionsForPeriod() method,
   which should use an iterator to traverse the subscriptions. Partially accepting
   with for-each loop.
   See project description excerpt:
   "Use an iterator in the getNumSupscriptionsForPeriod() method of the Country class. 
   This method should use the iterator to traverse the list of SubscriptionYear elements."
   Next time minus three for key requirements such as this.
      
-Bita.
