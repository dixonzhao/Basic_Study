FEEDBACK:

Good exception handling in CSVReader constructor.
    However, consider being more specific about the type of exception you are catching.


Very good documentation of your implementation.


-0 Why are you hard coding the numerical value instead of using a char type directly?
			if(temp.charAt(i)==44){
				if(temp.charAt(i+1)>=48 && temp.charAt(i+1)<=57) {
				

-1 For future, include additional test cases as required by project description.
        Next time minus one for each case.
	For example, check for a broader range of valid test cases.
    Next time minus one for each..
    	
	
Very good detailed README.

-Bita.
