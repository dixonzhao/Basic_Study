FEEDBACK:

Well done in converting your array to the more flexible linked 
    list data structure!
    
    
-0.5 Incomplete implementation of CountryList toString() method which should 
   call the toString() method of class Country. The data structure should not
   be aware of the contents of the data. For example, why are you calling the
   getName() method of a Country object element?
   
   Next time minus two for this.
   
   
Very good detailed description in README outlining the purpose of your new classes.

-Bita.
